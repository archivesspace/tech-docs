Once it is ready, confirm that ArchivesSpace is running correctly by accessing the following URLs in your browser:

- http://localhost:8089/ -- the backend
- http://localhost:8080/ -- the staff interface
- http://localhost:8081/ -- the public interface
- http://localhost:8082/ -- the OAI-PMH server
- http://localhost:8090/ -- the Solr admin console

To start using the Staff interface application, log in using the administrator account:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

Then, you can create a new repository by selecting "System" -> "Manage repositories" at the top right hand side of the screen. From the "System" menu, you can perform a variety of administrative tasks,
such as creating and modifying user accounts. **Be sure to change the "admin" user's password at this time.**
