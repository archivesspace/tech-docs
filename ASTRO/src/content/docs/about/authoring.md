title: Authoring content

Tech Docs content is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) which is a markup language used for formatting plain text that aims to be easy to read and write.

Tech Docs uses [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), a variant of Markdown syntax, and [SmartyPants](https://daringfireball.net/projects/smartypants/), a typographic punctuation plugin. These tools provide authors niceties like generating clickable links from text, creating lists and tables, formatting for quotations and em-dashes, and much more.

## Commonly-used Markdown syntax

Common use of Markdown throughout Tech Docs includes:

- [headings](#headings)
- [links](#links)
- [emphasizing text](#emphasizing-text)
- [paragraphs](#paragraphs)
- [lists](#lists)
- [code examples](#code-examples)
- [asides](#asides)
- [images](#images)

### Headings

Start a new line with between 2 and 6 number/hash/pound signs (`#`), followed by a single space, and then the heading text.

```md
## Example heading
```

The number of `#` signs corresponds to the heading level in the document hierarchy. **The first heading level (`#`) is reserved for the page title** (available in the page [frontmatter](#frontmatter)). Therefore the first _authored_ heading on every page should be a second level heading (`##`).

:::note[Second level heading requirement]
Authored headings should start at the second level (`##`) on every page, since the first level (`#`) is reserved for the page title which is machine-generated.
:::

```md
<!-- example.md -->

## Second level heading

Notice the page starts with a second level heading.

Notice the blank lines above and below each heading.

### Third level heading

This is demo text under the Third level heading section.

#### Fourth level heading

##### Fifth level heading

###### Sixth and final level heading
```

### Links

Create a link by wrapping the link text in brackets (`[ ]`) followed by the external link URL, or internal link path, wrapped in parentheses (`( )`).

```md
[text](URL or path)
```

There should be no space between the wrapped text and URL. When linking to an internal Tech Docs page, use the relative path from the current page, and omit the page file extension (`.md`).

:::note[Internal link requirements]
Links to other Tech Docs pages should:

1. be relative from the current file
2. not include the file extension (`.md`)

:::

```md
<!-- example.md -->

Here's an internal link to the [releases page](../development/releases).

Here's an [external link](https://github.com/archivesspace/tech-docs).
```

### Emphasizing text

Wrap text to be emphasized with `*` for italics, `**` for bold, and `~~` for strikethrough.

```md
<!-- example.md -->

_Italicized_ text

**Bold** text

**_Bold and italicized_** text

~~Strikethrough~~ text
```

### Paragraphs

Create paragraphs by leaving a blank line between lines of text.

```md
<!-- example.md -->

This is one paragraph.

This is another paragraph.
```

### Lists

Precede each line in a list with a dash (`-`) for a bulleted list, or a number followed by a period (`1.`) for an ordered list.

```md
<!-- example.md -->

- Resource
- Digital Object
- Accession

1. Accession
2. Digital Object
3. Resource
```

### Code examples

Wrap inline code with a single backtick (`` ` ``).

Wrap code blocks with triple backticks (` ``` `), also known as a "code fence", placed just above and below the code. Append the name of the code's language or its file extension to the first set of backticks for syntax highlighting.

````md
<!-- example.md -->

The `JSONModel` class is central to ArchivesSpace.

```ruby
def h(str)
  ERB::Util.html_escape(str)
end
```
````

### Asides

Asides are useful for highlighting secondary or marketing information.

Wrap content in a pair of triple colons (`:::`) and append one of the aside types (ie: `note`) to the first set of colons. The aside types are `note`, `tip`, `caution`, and `danger`, each of which have their own set of colors and icon. Customize the title by wrapping text in brackets (`[ ]`) placed after the note type.

:::note
Asides are a custom Markdown feature provided by the underlying [Starlight framework](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/authoring-content/#asides) that builds the Tech Docs.
:::

:::tip[Customize the aside title]
Customize the the aside title by wrapping text in brackets (`[ ]`) after the note type, in this case `tip`.
:::

```md
<!-- example.md -->

:::tip
Become an ArchivesSpace member today! ðŸŽ‰
:::

:::note[Some custom title]

### Markdown is supported in asides

![Pic alt text](../../../images/example.jpg)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur, adipisicing elit.
:::
```

### Images

Show an image using an exclamation point (`!`), followed by the image's [alt text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt_attribute) (a brief description of the image) wrapped in brackets (`[ ]`), followed by the external URL, or internal path, wrapped in parentheses (`( )`).

```md
<!-- example.md -->

![A dozen Krispy Kreme donuts in a box](https://example.com/donuts.jpg)

![The ArchivesSpace logo](../../../images/logo.svg)
```

:::note[Put images in `src/images`]
All internal images belong in the `src/images` directory. The relative path to images from this file is `../../../images`.
:::

## Frontmatter

Tech Docs uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) frontmatter as a way to add metadata to pages for dynamic purposes. Frontmatter is a block of YAML syntax used to assign variables and more, wrapped in triple dashes (`---`). Every page must have at least its `title` defined in frontmatter.

:::note[Frontmatter `title` requirement]
Every page must have frontmatter that defines the page `title`.
:::

```md
---
title: New page title
---
```

## Image files

All internal image files used in Tech Docs content should go in the `src/images` directory, located at the root of this project.

## Writing conventions

- Plugins, not plug-ins
- Titles are sentence-case ("Application monitoring with New Relic")
- Page titles prefer '-ing' verb forms ("Using MySQL", "Serving over HTTPS")
